The Bike Sharing Demand Analytics project focuses on predicting the demand for bike rentals using machine learning and data analysis techniques. It is a practical application of data science that helps bike-sharing companies improve operational efficiency, manage inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Objective
The project aims to forecast bike rental demand based on various factors, such as weather conditions, time, and seasonal trends. Accurate demand predictions enable companies to allocate resources effectively and reduce operational challenges.

Dataset
The project utilizes data containing:

Temporal information: Date, time, season, holidays, and working days.
Weather details: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Rental counts: Number of casual and registered users.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features, such as peak hours, weekend indicators, and weather classifications, to improve prediction accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonality, and correlations through visualizations.
Model Development: Using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to build predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Employing metrics such as RMSE and R-squared to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy and reliability.
Applications
Optimizing bike distribution to meet real-time demand.
Reducing costs by avoiding overstocking or underutilization.
Improving customer satisfaction by ensuring bike availability during peak times.
This project is an excellent example of how data science can solve real-world problems by leveraging historical data, advanced analytics, and predictive modeling. It also highlights the role of data-driven decision-making in optimizing urban mobility solutions.
